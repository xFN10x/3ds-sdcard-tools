Some tools for moving/doing things with your SD card without using File Explorer

# How to Use
1. You will need to install [Lua<sup>RT</sup>](https://luart.org/index.html#section_download), which is basically Lua for Windows.
2. After you download and install it, (Take note, IT WILL NOT MAKE A NEW FOLDER!!!) you will have to go to the bin folder.
3. Now download the [latest source code](https://github.com/xFN10x/3ds-sdcard-tools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) extract it, then go to assets/tool and drag the .wlua file you want to run into wlart.exe (in Lua<sup>RT</sup>'s bin folder)
4. Now it should be open! (if it randomly closes, report what you were doing before that happened in [Issues](https://github.com/xFN10x/3ds-sdcard-tools/issues).
